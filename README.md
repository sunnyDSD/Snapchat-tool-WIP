Project Status
ðŸš§ Work In Progress (WIP) ðŸš§
This is an advanced brute-forcing tool tailored for Snapchat login, combining a mix of asynchronous requests, proxy support, CAPTCHA handling, and Tor integration to avoid detection and maximize efficiency.

Features
Asynchronous Requests with AIOHTTP for fast, efficient brute-force attempts.
CAPTCHA Handling with OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, and Selenium for both text-based and interactive CAPTCHAs.
Proxy Support for HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies, ensuring request rotation and avoiding rate limits.
Tor Network Integration for free, continuous IP rotation.
Logging for tracking each login attempt, errors, and successes.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SnapBot.git
cd SnapBot
Install Required Dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install dependencies from requirements.txt.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install and Configure Tor (optional but recommended): Install Tor to enable IP rotation.

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install tor
Then start Tor:

bash
Copy code
sudo service tor start
Download a Password List:

For testing, add a password list as passwords.txt in the SnapBot directory. See the passwords section below for recommended sources.
Configuration
Open config.py to customize the botâ€™s settings. Key settings include:

TARGET_URL: URL of the Snapchat login page.
USERNAME: Target Snapchat username.
PASSWORD_FILE: File path to your password list.
PROXY_LIST: File path to your proxy list (supports HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5).
THREAD_COUNT: Number of threads for brute-force attempts.
CAPTCHA_TYPE: Set to image, audio, or interactive depending on the type of CAPTCHA expected.
TOR_ENABLED: Set to True to use Tor for IP rotation (recommended).
Example config.py
python
Copy code
TARGET_URL = "https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/login"
USERNAME = "target_username"
PASSWORD_FILE = "passwords.txt"
PROXY_LIST = "proxies.txt"
THREAD_COUNT = 10
DELAY_RANGE = (1, 5)
CAPTCHA_TYPE = "interactive"
LOG_FILE = "logs/attempts.log"
USER_AGENTS = [
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)"
]
TOR_ENABLED = True
Usage
Ensure Tor is Running (if using Tor):

bash
Copy code
sudo service tor start
Run the Bot:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Optional Arguments
Modify config.py for additional control over proxy types, CAPTCHA handling, and logging.

Password List
For brute-forcing, we recommend using a comprehensive password list such as:

SecLists on GitHub - A huge collection of security-related wordlists.
RockYou.txt - Famous password list created from leaked passwords.
Add your password list as passwords.txt in the root directory.

To-Do List
 Optimize CAPTCHA recognition accuracy.
 Add custom error handling for failed proxies.
 Implement multi-language support for enhanced usability.
 Add support for additional CAPTCHA solving techniques.
 Improve log formatting and output.
